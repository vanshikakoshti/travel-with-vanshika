about

Travel with Vanshika is a personal travel website designed and developed to showcase my skills in web design and front-end development while reflecting my passion for travel and storytelling.

This project demonstrates my ability to create a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly website using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The design focuses on clean layouts, smooth navigation, and engaging visuals to provide an immersive browsing experience.

Through this project, I highlight how creativity and functionality can come together to build a professional digital presence — one that not only shares travel experiences but also represents strong design principles and technical expertise.

Travel with Vanshika is my personal travel website where I blend my passion for exploring new places with my love for clean and creative web design. It’s more than just a travel blog — it’s a digital reflection of how I see the world through both code and curiosity.

Here, you’ll find travel experiences, guides, and inspiration wrapped in a simple, user-friendly design that I’ve built using modern web technologies. My goal is to make every visitor feel connected to the adventure — whether it’s through stories, visuals, or smooth web experiences.

Through Travel with Vanshika, I aim to inspire others to explore the world and embrace creativity in every journey. Each destination I visit becomes a new story, a new lesson, and a new design idea — reminding me that travel isn’t just about where you go, but how you see and create along the way
